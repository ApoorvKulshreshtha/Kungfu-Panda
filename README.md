The logic and the codes have been created by us.
For PlayMuzic and TimeCounter classes, we took assistance of the codes on the internet.
The images for Hangman have also been downloaded from the internet.
The screenshots have been taken from the movie Kung Fu Panda.

**Please Note** : We have used sun.java packages for implementing sound in our game. These packages may sometimes throw an error in Eclipse due to deprecation of some of the methods. To get rid of the error and run the game, please follow these steps:

In Eclipse main window go to
Windows -> Preferences -> Java -> Compiler -> Errors/Warnings -> Deprecated and restricted API -> Forbidden reference (access rules): -> change to warning

The class diagram and Argo UML project are included.
Also find the Use Case Diagram and Collaboration Diagram in the Argo UML project. The snapshots for these diagrams have been included in case the Argo UML software is unavailable.
